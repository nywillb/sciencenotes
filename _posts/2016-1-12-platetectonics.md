#When the earth was made
The earth was made a *long* time ago. **4.56 bya**(that means billion years ago) to be precise.

##How the earth was made
The earth was made when multiple astroids in the formation of the solar system clumped together. Because of gravity (Things are attracted to things with more mass), more and more astroids hit the earth.

##What the earth was like when it was made
When the earth was made, it had an **anerobic atmosphere** (an atmosphere without any oxygen). It was **hot**, and was **completely molten rock**. After the surface of the earth started to cool, it solidified. The crust, directly out of formation, had **volcanoes erupting all over it**.

##How did ocean basins form?
The crust was made of **two different materials, Basalt, and Granite. Basalt, being more dense than granite sunk, when granite rose.**

##How did water get to earth?
Many of the meteors carried small amounts of water. When they hit earth, the water was released. After many meteors hit earth, the amount of water multiplied, and because of gravity, the water moved down, into the ocean basin.

#After the earth was made
A lot of stuff happened after the earth was made. The time after the earth was made was spit into 3 Eons, and those eons were split into eras, and so on. You can see the whole chart below:

##The age of reptiles
######251 mya (that means million years ago) to 186 mya.
Some of the first animals on earth were reptiles. **Reptiles lived during the Mesozoic Era**, therefore, it is commonly called the age of the Reptiles.

##The First Humans
######10,000 years ago
**The first *homo sapiens*, or humans, evolved around 10,000 years ago.**

##Plate Boundaries
Plates, or parts of the earth's crust meet in different ways.

###Divergent Plate Boundaries
A divergent plate boundary is a mid ocean ridge. See "Sea Floor Spreading" later down for more about divergent plate boundaries.

###Convergent/Subductive Plate Boundaries

Subductive Plate Boundaries are **places where one plate moves under another.** It causes volcanic activity and earthquakes.

Convergent Plate Boundaries are **places were two plates move together**. They create mountians.

###Transform Plate Boundaries
On transform boundaries, **plates move past each other.** They cause earthquakes. An example of this is the San Andreas Fault.

##Continental Drift
###The origin of the theory
Alfred Wegener *(1880 - 1930)* noticed that **the continents fit together**, specifically South America and Africa (Don't understand? Look at  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTVf9nRpeDs) video.). He hypothesized that they were one connected. Most scientists of Wegener's time did not agree with Wegener because **they did not see any evidence on how or if the continents (plates) moved**, other than the continents fitting together.

###Proofs
Later, scientists found more proof that the continents fit together:

* Non flying/swimming animals found on multiple continents
* Plants with heavy eggs (specifically the Glossopteris) that cannot be transported between continents found on multiple continents
* Glacial Striations (lines that glaciers make as they move) found on multiple continents.
* Continents fit together

###Sea Floor Spreading
Sea floor spreading is the way that the continents move.
####Mid ocean rift
Sea floor spreading is the concept that in the middle of the ocean, there is a **mid ocean ridge where new crust is formed. As this crust expands, the ocean gets bigger**. An example of this is in the Atlantic ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean is expanding. Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is getting smaller.

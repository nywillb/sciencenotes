#When the earth was made
The earth was made a *long* time ago. **4.56 billion years ago** to be percise.
##How the earth was made
The earth was made when multiple astroids in the formation of the solar system clumped together. Because of gravity (Things are attracted to things with more mass), more and more astroids hit the earth.
##What the earth was like when it was made
When the earth was made, it had an **anerobic atmosphere** (an atmosphere without any oxygen). It was **hot**, and was **completely molten rock**. After the surface of the earth started to cool, it solidified. The crust, directly out of formation, had **volcanoes erupting all over it**.
##How did ocean basins form?
The crust was made of **two different materials, Basalt, and Granite. Basalt, being more dense than granite sunk, when granite rose.**
##How did water get to earth?
Many of the meteors carried small amounts of water. When they hit earth, the water was released. After many meteors hit earth, the amount of water multiplied, and because of gravity, the water moved down, into the ocean basin.

#After the earth was made
A lot of stuff happened after the earth was made. The time after the earth was made was spit into 3 Eons, and those eons were split into eras, and so on. You can see the whole chart below:

##The age of reptiles
<pre>
Some of the first animals on earth were reptiles. **Reptiles lived during the Mesozoic Era***
